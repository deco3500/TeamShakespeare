##1 Project Introduction
###1.1 Summary
Nowadays, It’s getting increasingly difficult for tourists to find the news in the location they arrived. When tourists go to a particular place, for example, The University of Queensland, they may want to know what has happened around this area recently. Using a smartphone to search “UQ News” in the web browser and look for the news posted recently is a way to solve this issue, but it can be very mundane. Open the browser, go to Google and wait for it to load is painful, which takes up precious time and possibly unwanted advertisements popups. 
“Shake Shake“ is a Mobile App that saves users’ time through a built-in news search function to dig the news around the user by simply shaking his smartphone. The user will always be updated with the news he wants within the radius using shake function.

- People get used to fast-paced life and are not willing to spend a long time to read a long news article.
- The ways people receive and read the news are limited.
- There are only two ways -- receive and reading in traditional news reading. People get bored through this two ways gradually. 
- Lack of interaction between reader and news.
