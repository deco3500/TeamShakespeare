##1 Project Introduction
###1.1 Summary
Nowadays, It’s getting increasingly difficult for tourists to find the news in the location they arrived. When tourists go to a particular place, for example, The University of Queensland, they may want to know what has happened around this area recently. Using a smartphone to search “UQ News” in the web browser and look for the news posted recently is a way to solve this issue, but it can be very mundane. Open the browser, go to Google and wait for it to load is painful, which takes up precious time and possibly unwanted advertisements popups. 
“Shake Shake“ is a Mobile App that saves users’ time through a built-in news search function to dig the news around the user by simply shaking his smartphone. The user will always be updated with the news he wants within the radius using shake function.

###1.2 Dilemma
- Allodoxaphobia. Some people feel difficult when making the decision on reading what type of news while news flooding onto the screen.
- People get used to fast-paced life and are not willing to spend a long time to read a long news article.
- The ways people receive and read the news are limited.
- There are only two ways -- receive and reading in traditional news reading. People get bored through this two ways gradually. 
- Lack of interaction between reader and news.
- People find it boring to explore the news since all news are fed to their phones.


###1.3 Solution
###1.3.1 Concept
Comparing to reading news on newspaper or web browser, the smartphone has helped people feel more comfortable with a new kind of reading. This app which based on smartphone aims to solve current problems and introduce a revolutionary way of getting in touch with current trending news of what is happening around. By shaking the phone, the app will detect user’s location and open up random 5 news from 100 hottest news on the screen. The sweep radius of GPS could be set by users within 1 to 10 kilometers. The app keeps all the real-time updated news in memory, and news which happened more than seven days ago will be deleted. Users could comment or “favorite” the news, even share the trending news to social media like Facebook and Twitter. The “hot” news is determined by the numbers of “favorite” and comments. Also, the news could be filtered and blocked by setting keywords. Basically, the target user for this app is the everyone who has interests to explore what happened around them.
