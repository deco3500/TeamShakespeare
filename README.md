##1 Project Introduction

<a name="summary"/>
###1.1 Summary
Nowadays, It’s getting increasingly difficult for tourists to find the news in the location they arrived. When tourists go to a particular place, for example, The University of Queensland, they may want to know what has happened around this area recently. Using a smartphone to search “UQ News” in the web browser and look for the news posted recently is a way to solve this issue, but it can be very mundane. Open the browser, go to Google and wait for it to load is painful, which takes up precious time and possibly unwanted advertisements popups. 
“Shake Shake“ is a Mobile App that saves users’ time through a built-in news search function to dig the news around the user by simply shaking his smartphone. The user will always be updated with the news he wants within the radius using shake function.

<a name="dilemma"/>
###1.2 Dilemma
- Allodoxaphobia. Some people feel difficult when making the decision on reading what type of news while news flooding onto the screen.
- People get used to fast-paced life and are not willing to spend a long time to read a long news article.
- The ways people receive and read the news are limited.
- There are only two ways -- receive and reading in traditional news reading. People get bored through this two ways gradually. 
- Lack of interaction between reader and news.
- People find it boring to explore the news since all news are fed to their phones.


<a name="Solution"/>
###1.3 Solution
<a name="concept"/>
**1.3.1 Concept:**

Comparing to reading news on newspaper or web browser, the smartphone has helped people feel more comfortable with a new kind of reading. This app which based on smartphone aims to solve current problems and introduce a revolutionary way of getting in touch with current trending news of what is happening around. By shaking the phone, the app will detect user’s location and open up random 5 news from 100 hottest news on the screen. The sweep radius of GPS could be set by users within 1 to 10 kilometers. The app keeps all the real-time updated news in memory, and news which happened more than seven days ago will be deleted. Users could comment or “favorite” the news, even share the trending news to social media like Facebook and Twitter. The “hot” news is determined by the numbers of “favorite” and comments. Also, the news could be filtered and blocked by setting keywords. Basically, the target user for this app is the everyone who has interests to explore what happened around them. 

<a name="functions"/>
**1.3.2 Functions:**

**Basic Functions:**
- Users can sign up this App by phone number or some social platform accounts, include Facebook and Google account. When finish sign in, users are able to add the news to “favorite” and share the news that they like to friend.
- Users are able to edit personal profile, view the news that they put in favorite list, find more friends in “About me” page.
- Some other functions such as managing the accounts, logging out also could be found in "Settings" page. 

**Core Functions:**
- When the user shakes the phone, the App will generate five random news around current location, and lists the news headlines and briefing on the screen. By tapping one of the news user can read the full article.
A simple shake of the phone will bring up new stories throughout the day or the week, depends on the number of the news within current area.
- The news sweep radius can be set from 1km to 10km by the user.
- The news will be sorted into different categories, such as Politics, Business, Media, Style, Food and so on.
- The App will ask the user to customize the types of articles that they are willing to read before using the shake function. The user can change their reading appetite in the Setting menu at any time.
- The five random news are generated based on user’s interested topics from different trusted sources.
- Every time users shake the phone, the App will re-detect user’s current location and update the random five news around the user.
- Users can put the article into “Favorites” and read it later.
- Users also can choose to read the top five news around them. The top five news are generated from the nearest 100 news from the user based on the “favorites” rate.

##2 Target Audience
<a name="usergroup"/>
###2.1 User Group and Context of Use:

"Shake Shake" aims to target the people who want to dig the new stories that happening around them, which includes: 
Tourists, who are keen on exploring the city through the most talked about topics here. For example, a tourist visits Brisbane city for the first time. He has no idea how to explore this new city. He opens the "Shake Shake" App and simply shakes the phone, a list of new stories then come out, such as  “Top 10 Brisbane Restaurant 2016” posted by The Courier-Mail three days ago and “The Events You Can Not Miss this Weekend” posted by VisitBrisbane 15 hours ago. Now he knows where to find the most popular restaurant to settle his dinner and where to spend his weekend with local people in Brisbane. By using "Shake Shake", he can easily explore the city like local people.

People just moved there and wish to adapt to the new life quickly by getting to know what has happened around them recently. For example, when he goes to the Southbank, he opens the "Shake Shake" and shakes his phone, the news such as “Noodle Festival is holding in Brisbane”, “Highlights of the Noodle Festival 2016” are shown on the screen . when he goes to the City and shakes the phone, another bunch of news such as “Myer and David Jones hold back on Christmas discounting” may come out. He can get what happening around him easily.

Local residents who want to be updated with the latest news around where they live. For example, a user lives in Moreton Bay, he can stay informed on the go with the latest headlines and videos around him by shaking his phone. The news such as “5 cheapest Aussie suburbs with the best prospects” posted by Yahoo 7 Finance may come out under Business section. Because the suburb where he is living, Moreton Bay, is one of the five suburbs. Now he knows the value of his house.

<a name="difference"/>
###2.2 Different to Current News Mobile Apps:

For users, this app is not only a news App to obtain information,but also an App that introduces a new way to exploration what happened nearby. It is more immersive to know what has happened around the user than just know some news which happened in 8,000 kilometers away. For a tourist, or someone who is a new-comer, the best way for him to know what is around them is to explore the news that has happened there. For every user of this app, to deliver news nearby, like alerts about tomorrow’s storm or the closing of a bridge by just shaking phone is the main thing that this app works on.

As a brand-new novel physical interaction between reader and news that is never applied in traditional news mobile app, “shake shake” will promote the relationship between reader and news through new human-computer interaction. What’s more, this new app will break the traditional and conventions way of news obtaining, instead of traditional operations like. We confidently expect that the new interaction will arouse people’s interest of news reading.

Traditional news apps simply display all the information on a screen, which is an effective way to deliver information. However, for users, too much information lets them become dazzled, impatient and lose interests to read. This app is a filter for the tremendous volume of news available on-line. Every time users shake the phone, there is only five news showing on the screen. Giving users limited options contributes to overcoming their “allodoxaphobia” and also inspires their interests. 

<a name="team"/>
##3 Team introduction

Our team is called Shakespeare, as it is pronounced similarly with the idea of “shaking” news. Three of us are Information Technology students and another one majors in Multimedia Design. We believe we can all contribute to our project from both technical and user experience perspectives. Based on our background, we have allocated different roles and responsibilities, and agreements have been made on how to make decisions and how to deal with potential conflicts.

<a name="roles"/>
###3.1 Team Roles
- **Everyone** is expected to make equal efforts in the project. And each member will be treated the same when we are making team decisions.
- **Meng Li** plays a leading role in our team because he is experienced in team collaboration. As a team leader, he is responsible for the management of the whole project, including time management, organize group meetings, and keeping everyone’s work on track.
- **Yunxiao Li** is supposed to be in charge of logistics, including meeting preparation, transport and any other physical materials related to the project.
- **Mingyu Han** and Yunxiao Li both devote to the visual design of the app.
- **Shidi Yang** and Meng Li are responsible for the development of the project. They already have experience in implementation and expect themselves to improve their technical skills through this project.
- **Mingyu Han** is in charge of managing content and everyone can 
- **Everyone** in the team will participant in the process of user testing and reflection on the project.

<a name="decision"/>
###3.2 Decision Agreement Rules
- In team Shakespeare, any members can take part in the project discussion and decision made, any major decisions or idea relating to the development or improvement of the project must be agreed upon by all members. 
- We will emphasize collaboration and use consensus for important decisions and issues.
- We will mutually commit to our team’s objectives as stated in the team charter or negotiate until we can make this mutual commitment.
- We will maintain the team work plan and schedule each week.
- If a team member believes they are being asked to do a task outside the scope of the team’s charter,he/she will bring this to the attention of the team leader for resolution.
- When we pose an issue or a problem, we will also try to present a solution.

<a name="conflict"/>
###3.3 Rules for Conflict Management
- If any conflict arises it has to be brought up when we meet in person. This will ensure that no misinterpretation of motives is possible
- If the problem can’t be talked out by the conflictors, the team leader will act as a mediator for the argument
- If the team leader is a party to the conflict, another member of the team not involved will be appointed as the mediator for the argument
- The mediator will help to weigh the importance of each person’s issues, and decide how the conflict should be resolved, either by making sacrifices or by compromise
- If the mediator cannot make a decision, the rest of the team will be asked to help in deciding how the conflict should be resolved, and how the two conflictors can compromise
- The team’s decision on how the conflict will be resolved will be done via a democratic approach, where members will vote between what decision will be made to resolve the conflict
- If there are more than two decisions that can be voted upon, more discussion will be had to narrow the options down before making a final decision; with the small number of just six group members, making a choice on more than two options would not be optimal
- If the problem is still unsolved, we will contact a tutor for help in resolving the issue, as a last resort
- All members are expected to devote themselves equally to the amount of work required for the project, all members should keep contact with each other and each member must commit their part of this project and finish it on time to avoid insignificant conflicts and poor performance in Shakespeare. One more thing, if some members can not finish their work on time,they have to notify the leader or other members immediately. If any conflicts arose in Shakespeare, all involved members must try to resolve it peacefully. And all members must have a face to face meeting to solve problems if conflict happens.

- Files will be shared and stored on Github (including Zenhub) and Google Drive.
- Google Drive will be mainly used for collaboration on the documentation by Google Docs. User investigation files such as questionnaire will be done through Google Forms.
- Github will be used to store prototypes such as codes, wireframes, and diagrams. As a plugin of Github, it will be implemented to manage Github issues.

<a name="filename"/>
####3.5.2 File Naming Convention:

#####**Document/file references will include:**
- File name
- Name/role of file author(s) or originator(s)
- Date of creation, edition or event which is the subject of the document/file
- Version number if applicable
- Underscore to delimit words

#####**Naming Conventions:**
- Keep file and folder names short, but meaningful.
- Use capital letters to delimit words, not spaces.
- When including a personal name in a file name give the family name first followed by the initials.
- If using a date in the file name always state the date ‘back to front’, and - use four digit years, two digit months and two digit days: YYYYMMDD or YYYYMM or YYYY or YYYY-YYYY.
- Avoid using non-alphanumeric characters in file names.

<a name="choice"/>
###3.6 Social Platform Choice

Team Shakespeare makes use of **Slack**, **Github (with Zenhub plugin)**, **Google Docs** and **Facebook** as our online collaboration tools.
####Slack
Since deco3500.slack.com has been created for all to communicate and share files, it’s very convenient for us to both discuss our team’s idea in a secret channel and listen to the other’s in general channel. Moreover, Slack Integration is what takes it from a normal online instant messaging and collaboration system to a solution that enables you to centralize all your notifications. We have added integration with Github and Google Docs in Slack to keep track on other teammates’ action, which saves lots of time and make things easy. As a result, we choose Slack as our main communication method.

####Github

As one of the most popular distributed version control systems in the world, it’s extremely helpful and convenient for team Shakespeare to collaborate on the application development. We are able to manage other files’ version such as design images and documents as well. We will separate the project into small parts, create issues for each of them and assign to different team members. With the use of Zenhub, the issues will be managed in a more powerful way. The issues will be easily categorised which help us know who is working on which section. We will also create milestone using Zenhub according to the plan that we set.

####Google Docs

Collaboration on the document will be made on Google Docs, which makes it convenient for us to work together when working on reports or other paperwork. it is convenient because we can edit the document at any time. Every change or data renew will be saved automatically and immediately, which makes It efficiently prevent data reveal and facilitate document sharing in real time.

####Facebook

Facebook is used as the last resort for us to contact to each other in case there is no response in Slack. Files sharing will be made on it as well.
